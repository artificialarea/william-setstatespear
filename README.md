The code is organised into different branches which have progressively more complexity.

## The branches

### 1. Home Page

This branch adds a route for the home page

```bash
git checkout 1-homepage
```

### 2. Poem Page

This branch adds a dynamic route for the poem page

```bash
git checkout 2-poempage
```

### 3. Link Instances

This branch swaps all the anchors for Link components

```bash
git checkout 3-link-instances
```
